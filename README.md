# RNAnimate

Not much to see here. Just some fiddling around with React Native animations...

## Getting started

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
yarn ios
```

Or on Android, run these commands in stead of `yarn ios`:

```bash
adb devices # Make sure your Android device is connected
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
yarn android
```

## TODO

- Have a look at https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable
